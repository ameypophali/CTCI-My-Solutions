# CTCIMySolutions -
A repository for the programs written while practicing the book Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
The ideas for algorithms and solutions for a few instances in the repository may not be my own and have been adapted from the book or a third party resource. The purpose of the programs of writtern in the repository was to improve programming skills and logical thinking while aproaching a problem.
